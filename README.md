```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'logist'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install logist

## Usage

You have to use logist logger in your `config/evnrionments/[rails-env].rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  # ...
  config.logger = Logist::Logger.new(STDOUT)
end
```

You can change logger configuration like this:

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  # ...
  config.logger = Logist::Logger.new(STDOUT, datetime_format: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%:z:")
end
```

or

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  # ...
  config.logger = Logist::Logger.new(STDOUT)
  config.logger.formatter.datetime_format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%:z"
end
```

If you are using [lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge) it will automatically be configured to produce JSON output.

### flat_json option

If you want to log Hash object, but you don't want to have nested JSON, you can set `flat_json=true`:

```ruby
config.logger.formatter.flat_json = true
```

When `flat_json=false` (default):

```json
{"level":"INFO","message":{"foo":"bar"}}
```

When `flat_json=true`:

```json
{"level":"INFO","foo":"bar"}
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
